=> What is Tuple in Python?
    -> A Tuple is an immutable data type in Python.
    -> it is as treat as list in python. but Tuple is immutable.
    -> Tuple denoted by Parentheses and list is denoted by square parses.
        like-> tp = () ==> Empty Tuple
               tp = (1,) ==> Tuple with only one element needs a comma.
               tp = (1, 7, 9) ==> Tuple with more than one element.

    -> Once defined a tuple elements cant be altered or manipulated.

=> Tuple functions.
    -> Consider the following Tuple.
        like:- tp = (1, 7, 9, 3)

    1-> tp.count(1) --> This function will return number of times 1 occurs in Tuple tp.
    1-> tp.index(1) --> This function will return the index of first occurrence of 1 in Tuple tp.
