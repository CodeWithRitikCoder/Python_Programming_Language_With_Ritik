    => For loop iterative control statement in Python.
        -> In Python, there is no C style for loop, i.e., for (i=0; I <n; i++). There is a “for” loop which is similar
            to each loop in other languages. Let us learn how to use a loop for sequential traversals.

        => For Loops in Python
            -> Python For loop is used for sequential traversal i.e. it is used for iterating over an iterable
                like String, Tuple, List, Set, or Dictionary.

            -> Note: In Python, for loops only implement the collection-based iteration.

                    # statements
